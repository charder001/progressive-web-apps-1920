# Progressive Web Apps @cmda-minor-web · 2019-2020 - VinCheckup

## What does this app do?
The VinCheckup app allows the user to enter a vehicle VIN and build year in order to fetch information about that vehicle from a database using a fetch request.

## What API does this app use?
This app uses the vPic API which can be found at https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/
There is no limit to how many requests one user can make to the API, however, they do expect larger batch requests to be done in lower-traffic times. More information can be found here https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/Home/Index/FAQ.

## Features
Right now the user can enter a VIN and a model year to fetch data from the API. This will navigate the user to a detail page where more information is displayed.

## To do
- Add service worker
- Use build tools
- Make app installable
- Add styling

## Feedback week 2
3 Things to watch out for!
1. My service worker works now! Yay :) I had some struggles getting it to work but it's there now.
2. Now i need to find some use for the sevice worker, i'm thinking of implementing a cached versions of previous search queries.
