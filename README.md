## What does this app do?
The VinCheckup app allows the user to enter a vehicle VIN and build year in order to fetch information about that vehicle from a database using a fetch request.

## What API does this app use?
This app uses the vPic API which can be found at https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/
There is no limit to how many requests one user can make to the API, however, they do expect larger batch requests to be done in lower-traffic times. More information can be found here https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/Home/Index/FAQ.

## Features
Right now the user can enter a VIN and a model year to fetch data from the API. This will navigate the user to a detail page where more information is displayed. The visited pages are placed in the cache using a service worker, so they are available for offline viewing. This app also contains a manifest, which allows user to install the app to their device. Lastly, the critical render path of this application is optimized by using gulp to minimize and concatenate the CSS files.

## Installation
1. Open your terminal
2. Change directory to where you want to clone this repository, to the desktop for example

`cd desktop` 

3. Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/charder001/progressive-web-apps-1920`

4. Change direction into the newly created file

`cd progressive-web-apps-1920`

5. Install dependencies

`npm install`

6. Run application

`npm run`

## Learning goals
**1. I understand the difference between client side and server side renderen and can apply server side rendering by showing data from an API.

**2. I understand the ins and outs of a service worker and can apply them in my application in a meaningful manner.

**3. I understand how the critical render path works and how it can be optimized.

## To do
* Add google images API to load in images of vehicles
* Expand on styling
* Try out compressing files
* Add recent searches section
